This project deals with Sampling and Down-sampling of signals.

We first try out the principles of sampling and down-sampling on a normal sine wave and then move on to applying those on a real audio signal.

The `Assignment.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook with all the codes and output in it.

I have also created an online interactive notebook in which the parameters can be changed using simple sliders to try out their effect on the process and also to listen to the signal in the form of an audio file.
